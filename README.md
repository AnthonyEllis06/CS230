-------------------------------------
The gaming room client wanted us to create a design template for a game that would render images as clues for the players to guess.
------------------------------------
I think I did well in identifying the differences between platforms primarily because I used to test all the platforms for fun. I once had made a macbook be able to tripple boot with windows and different linux distrobutions.
------------------------------------
I found it helpful to know that creating design documents is a very necessary and useful thing. It allows for both the development team and client to better understand eachother in what the prject requirements are.
------------------------------------
The whole second half of the class. I feel like I gave you very mediocre work and it was due to life situations. Specifically the software requirements was a bit difficult because i didn't know at the time if it ment requirments as in hardware needed to run the software or what the software needed to do.
------------------------------------
It is import to consider the users needs because considering the users needs can create a more competitive and well regarded software.
------------------------------------
In the future I would start by planning more. I struggle with planning and software requirements is part of the planning and I want to implement that into my knowledge as a programmer.
